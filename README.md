## 🔧 **Core Concepts**

### 1. ✅ Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), Not Linear Chains
Repeater Chain utilizes a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** structure instead of a linear blockchain, allowing parallel transaction execution.

### 2. 🧠 AI-Powered Automatic Validators
AI validators replace traditional mining or staking mechanisms, providing efficient and secure transaction validation.

### 3. 🧬 Compact Block Structure
Blocks are optimized to reduce storage and bandwidth requirements using zk-SNARK compression.
